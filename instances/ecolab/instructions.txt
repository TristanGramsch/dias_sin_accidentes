This repo contains several legacy files. To minimize clutter, you can remove the following tracked files now that the app was reorganized:

- `server.js` (moved to `src/server.js`)
- `index.html` (moved to `public/index.html`)
- `script.js` (moved to `public/script.js`)
- `styles.css` (moved to `public/styles.css`)
- `entrypoint.sh` (optional; used by older Docker image)

Delete them only after confirming `src/` and `public/` versions work.
